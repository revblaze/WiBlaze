<b>WiBlaze</b> is an open-source web browser for the iOS and <a href="https://github.com/revblaze/Glow">macOS</a> platforms. <sup><a href="https://github.com/revblaze/Glow">Glow Browser for macOS</a></sup>

## Goals
The WiBlaze web browser was built from the ground up for durability, and above all, speed. The end goal is to create a beautiful product, written in Swift.
